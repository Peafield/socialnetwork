/*
UserHandler is a general HTTP request handler for actions related to users.
It is designed to process different HTTP methods (GET, PUT, DELETE) and call the corresponding functions for each method.
The POST method is not accounted for as this is assigned in the sign up handler.

Based on the HTTP method, it will:

	GET: Retrieve user/s using GetUserHandler(w, r)
	PUT: Update a user's account using UpdateUserHandler(w, r)
	DELETE: Delete a user's account using DeleteUserHandler(w, r)

If the request's HTTP method is not one of the above, the function will respond with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status,
indicating that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something perceived to be a client error.

Parameters:
  - w (http.ResponseWriter): An HTTP ResponseWriter interface that forms the response that will be written to the HTTP connection.
  - r (*http.Request): A pointer to the HTTP request received from the client.

Usage:

http.HandleFunc("/user", UserHandler)

In this example, UserHandler is registered with the HTTP package's default ServeMux (which is a HTTP request router).
This means that any HTTP request sent to the path "/user" on the server will be processed by UserHandler.

UpdateUserHandler is an HTTP handler for updating a user account in the database.
This function extracts user data and update user data from the HTTP request context, then updates the users account.

Parameters:
  - w (http.ResponseWriter): An HTTP ResponseWriter interface that forms the response that will be written to the HTTP connection.
  - r (*http.Request): A pointer to the HTTP request received from the client.

Specifically, it:
  - Attempts to extract the user data from the context of the request. If it fails, it sends an HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) status to the client, with an error message indicating that it failed to read the user data from the context.
  - Attempts to extract the update user data from the context of the request. If it fails, it sends an HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) status to the client, with an error message indicating that it failed to read the update user data from the context.
  - Calls controllers.UpdateUserAccount to update a user. If it fails, it sends an HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) status to the client, with an error message indicating that it failed to update the user account.
  - If all of the above steps are successful, it sends an HTTP 200 (OK) status to the client, indicating that the comment was successfully updated.
